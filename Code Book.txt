The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project¡¯s definition.

1. Download the dataset directly using given URL and extracted under the folder called "UCI HAR Dataset"

2. library "tidyverse" package

3. For step 1, read in relevant files into R first and assign column names. Using R command "rbind" and "cbind" to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

4. For step 2, use dplyr::select with contains() to subset the columns "subject", "label", and only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

5. For step 3, replace "label" column with corresponding descriptive activity names in activity_labels.txt 

6. For step 4, first extract column names out and assign them to a new vector called "name" for easier manipulation. Use stringr::str_replace_all to replace corresponding strings.

7. For step 5, "data5" is created by sumarizing "data2" taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
